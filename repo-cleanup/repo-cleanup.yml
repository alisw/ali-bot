# Configuration file for repo-cleanup.py.
#
# You decide what packages to keep/purge here, just copy the examples. Every
# package mentioned here not matching any version rule is *kept* by default.
#
# All the other packages not mentioned here are considered non-toplevel and are
# removed if no toplevel package needs them.
#
# Note that there are two rules possible for each version regexp:
#   purgeOlderThan: [days|"never"]
#     will purge if older than days, or never
#   excludeFromPurge: ["firstOfMonth"|"lastOfMonth"]
#     will group packages containing a date in the format YYYYMMDD in monthly
#     groups and retain either the first one or the last of the month
