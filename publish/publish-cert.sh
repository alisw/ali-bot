# Sync certificates from the CERN IT-managed directory to CVMFS. By default it
# runs from 5am every morning, determined by the system's timezone.
#
# Note that:
#
#  * the destination directory is completely replaced by source certificates,
#  * it is possible to define exceptions (i.e. manually-added certificates),
#  * certificate revocation lists are *not* copied: they are erased on the
#    destination
#
# Use FORCE=1 to force this script to sync certs in any case.
# Use DRYRUN=1 to see what would be done without actually executing it.
#
# Usage example:
#   env DRYRUN=1 FORCE=1 ./publish-cert.sh
