# On alissandra machines, use 28 cores instead as we have the capacity there to
# use that many, and they will only have one builder running on them at a time.
# We have to use backticks instead of $() as bash 3.2 (installed on MacOS) gets
# confused by the latter due to the unmatched parens in the case statement.
