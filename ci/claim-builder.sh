# A build loop that takes work by CLAIMING it, rather than by owning a hash
# shard of it. The claimed counterpart of continuous-builder.sh.
#
# continuous-builder.sh is deliberately left alone: it drives every production
# builder, and the two differ in ways that cannot be expressed as a flag --
# which PRs a worker considers, how it avoids duplicating another worker, and
# whether it re-execs itself. Running them side by side is also what lets a
# single pool be migrated at a time. See ci/SCALING_PLAN.md, Phases 1-3.
#
# What it does each round:
#   1. optionally source $ROUND_SETUP, for credentials that expire;
#   2. refresh the *.env files from ali-bot@master;
#   3. list every buildable PR, in the order the lister recommends;
#   4. walk that list and build the FIRST one it can claim;
#   5. sleep only if it built nothing.
#
# Because every worker asks for the whole list and claims decide who builds
# what, workers need no coordination and no identity: add one and the queue
# drains faster, remove one and its claim lapses. That is the property the hash
# sharding cannot provide.
#
# Environment:
#   MESOS_ROLE, CUR_CONTAINER, ALIBOT_CONFIG_SUFFIX   which pool to serve
#   GITHUB_TOKEN                                       (or via $ROUND_SETUP)
#   ROUND_SETUP    optional file SOURCED at the start of every round. Sourced,
#                  not run, so it can export credentials into this shell --
#                  which is the point: a gate token from a credential broker
#                  expires, and re-execing would carry a stale one forever.
#   IDLE_SLEEP     seconds to wait after a round that built nothing (300)
