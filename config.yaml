# This rule-set gets applied on each tag present in git.
# Rules are evaluated in the order they appear.
# - If a tag matches a black list rule, it's discarded and evaluation
#   of rules for that tag stops.
# - If a tag matches an inclusion rule, it's added to the list of builds
#   to be done, and evaluation continues.

# Do not build old releases, we do not care about them, at least for now.
